# advance-diary

This is a Java and Maven diary application that allows users to save notes and information about their life experiences. 
The application uses the File system to store the registered users' diary entries, which are stored in an object form that makes it unreadable for unauthorized access. 
Users need to log in with their credentials to access their diary contents, which are presented in a readable form. 
The application provides a secure and personalized way for users to keep track of their life experiences.
In addition, I used JUnit tests to ensure the functionality of the application. 
I took steps to verify that the various features of the application work as expected and that any errors or bugs are identified and fixed before the application is released. 
Overall, the application provides users with a reliable and secure way to save and access their personal diary entries.
